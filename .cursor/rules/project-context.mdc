# OSM Batching Tool - Project Context

## Context Priority
1. **ALWAYS read README.md first** - Contains comprehensive project overview, structure, and functionality details
2. Read relevant source files in `src/` for implementation details  
3. Check `proto/osm_import.proto` for gRPC API contract

## Project Overview
This is a Rust-based OSM (OpenStreetMap) data processing service that:
- Downloads OSM data files (PBF/OSC) from Geofabrik
- Converts and batches data for consumption via gRPC API
- Handles both full imports (historical) and delta updates
- Processes data for Bangladesh region specifically

## Key Files
- `src/main.rs` - gRPC server and request handling
- `src/lib.rs` - Core OSM processing logic
- `proto/osm_import.proto` - gRPC service definitions
- `Cargo.toml` - Dependencies and project configuration

## Architecture Notes
- Async Rust with Tokio runtime
- gRPC service using Tonic framework
- Streaming file downloads with progress tracking
- XML parsing and batching without loading full files in memory
- Background processing with lock file coordination
